### Apache Spark (Pyspark) for NLP
Using Spark framework for the given dataset of movies with training features **movie_id**, **movie_name**, **plot**, **genre**, build Logistic Regression model for multi-label classification of movies according to their **genre**.  
For building features from the movie description I used two approaches  
**(A) TF-IDF**  
**(B) GloVe Embeddings**
